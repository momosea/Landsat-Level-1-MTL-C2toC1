# Landsat-MTL-C2toC1

Landsat data provided by the USGS are distributed as a single file in an archived and zipped ".TAR" format. These files must be extracted and uncompressed before you can use them.

In ENVI 5, open the metadata file (MTL.txt) Â through **File> Open as> Landsat> GeoTIFF with Metadata** to import Landsat Collection 1 Level 1 image with all bands in the correct order.

At the end of 2020, USGS released [Landsat Collection 2](https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/december-7-2020-new-landsat-update-special-issue-landsat-collection-2-now-available?qt-news_science_products=4#qt-news_science_products). There are [enhancements and changes between Collection 1 and Collection 2 Level-1 metadata](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-collection-2-metadata), the current highest version of ENVI (ENVI 5.6) has not yet supported the reading of Landsat Collection 2 MTL files.

Modifying the MTL file in batches manually is time-consuming, here is a script to realize it.

## ðŸ“¢ File list
- A source code based on python 3.6;
- An executable file for more convenient use bundled by package **[**PyInstaller**](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)**;
- Sample files in inputs folder and outputs folders.

## ðŸ“¢ How to use 
Put the MTL files of Collection 2 format into the **inputs folder** in the same directory. After the script runs, the converted MTL file of Collection 1 format will be generated in the **outputs folder** in the same directory.

**Note:** 
There is no GROUP of PRODUCT_PARAMETERS in the sample MTL files, so **"Can't find PRODUCT_PARAMETERS"** will be printed. This error has no effect on the result.
